# Hi this is a really simple react project with a pretty simple User Interface
## whats the goal?
well it sorta acts like a gallery, all you hab to do is drag and drop an image or click the button then click the image and thats all basically!

source code?? well you're likely looking at it but hey! no harm to add a github link right?? so here: [click me](https://github.com/EsinShadrach/imagePreview)

and more importantly here's a preview!! [click here!](https://)

Ignore the weird site name, i kinda like the way netlify weirdly name stuff...
